    <h2>CHAPTER I. <br>
        Down the Rabbit-Hole
    </h2>
    <p><b>Alice</b> was beginning to get very tired of sitting <mark>by her sister on the bank</mark> , and of having
        nothing to do: once or
        twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and
        what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”</p>

    <p> <u>So she was considering in her own mind</u> (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy
        and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the <s>trouble of getting up and
            picking the daisies</s> , when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
    <!-- fdfdf -->
    <p> <i>There was nothing so very remarkable in that</i> ; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear
        the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred
        to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the
        Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and
        <!--  then --> hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before
        seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran
        across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the
        hedge.
